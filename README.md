# FEM_1D_loding_solver
This Project was done during my second year of Mechanical Engineering at Ecole National Polytechnique. it is mainly a comparison between two proposed models for studying the longitudinals strain of a conical body, using FEM.

The file FEM _axial_loading_SEMMAD gives the description of the problem.

HW_Ap_5: Matlab code for application 5 (first model)

HW_Ap_6: Matlab Code for application 6 (second model)
